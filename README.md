## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a RESTful API, developed as part of a course on API development with Java and Spring Boot. It showcases:
- Using Spring Boot for rapid development.
- Integration with a MySQL database.
- Implementing JPA for data access.
- Setting up a Maven-based project.

## Features
- RESTful endpoints for managing data.
- Integration with MySQL for data storage.
- Development tools for fast application iteration.
- Unit testing with Spring Boot.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 21**: The programming language used for this project.
- **Spring Boot 3.4.1**: Framework for building the application.
  - `spring-boot-starter-web`: For building RESTful APIs.
  - `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: For JPA-based data access.
  - `spring-boot-devtools`: For hot reloading during development.
  - `spring-boot-starter-test`: For unit testing.
- **MySQL**: Database for persistence.
- **Maven**: Dependency and build management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java 21
- Maven 3.6+
- MySQL Server

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/magical-grass.git
   cd magical-grass
   ```
2. Configure the database:
   - Create a database in MySQL (e.g., `magical_grass`).
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/magical_grass
     spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
     spring.datasource.password=<your-password>
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     ```

### Running the Application
1. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage
- Access the API documentation (if applicable) at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` (requires Swagger setup).
- Test the RESTful endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.
